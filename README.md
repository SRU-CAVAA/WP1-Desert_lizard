# Enabling robot autonomy through self-regulatory dynamics

## ü¶é Abstract

From weaving spiders to hibernating mammals and migratory birds, nature presents numerous examples of organisms exhibiting extraordinary autonomous behaviors that ensure their self-maintenance. However, physiological needs often interact and compete with each other, which demands super-autonomous organisms to orchestrate them as a complex set of internal needs rather than as isolated subsystems. This paper presents a synthetic agent equipped with a brain-based neural mass model replicating fundamental self-regulatory behaviors observed in desert lizards. Our results show this agent not only autonomously regulates its internal temperature by navigating to areas with optimal environmental conditions but also harmonizes this process with other internal needs, such as energy, hydration, security, and mating. Using game theory metrics, we observe that such a biomimetic agent outperforms an interoceptive-agnostic agent in efficiency, fairness, and stability. Together, our results suggest that grounding robot behavior in biological processes of self-regulation provides an excellent approach for addressing trade-off situations in the physical deployments of autonomous robots.

## üß† Project description

This repository includes the source code for replicating the self-regulatory behavior of a desert lizard. Preliminary results were showcased at IROS2023 as part of the workshop [Learning Robot Super Autonomy](https://wp.nyu.edu/workshopiros2023superautonomy/).

Full paper is intended to be submitted at [ALIFE 2025 conference](https://2025.alife.org/).

### üß© Components

The repository includes several executable files:

- **Epuck Launch**   
  Launches the Webots simulation using hyperparameters defined in `config.ini`.

- **Gradients Node**  
  Generates gradients that indicate resources' locations and assist robot navigation.

- **Allostatic model Node**  
  Implements the Neural-mass multiattractor model of allostatic orchestration.

- **Robot navigation Node**   
  Integrates gradient's and allostatic model's information to guide robot's navigation.

- **Data Gathering Node**  
  Collects simulation metrics and stores them in a `.csv` file at the end of each experimental session.
  
- **Supervisor Node**  
  Manages simulation-level tasks such as resetting, plotting, and tracking spatial metrics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

> üêß This repository was developed on **WSL-Ubuntu 22.04** for Windows 11, but it also supports native Linux installations.

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 (or WSL-Ubuntu 22.04 on Windows)
- Python `3.10.12`

### üêß Linux 

1. Install [**Webots**](https://cyberbotics.com/).
2. Install [**ROS2 Iron Irwini**](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation.html).
3. Install [**webots_ros2**](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Webots/).

### ü™ü Windows 11 via WSL2

> üí° We can provide a pre-configured WSL environment for convenience. To install manually:

1. Install [**Webots**](https://cyberbotics.com/) natively on Windows.
2. Create a WSL-Ubuntu 22.04 instance.
3. Follow Linux steps 2 and 3 inside WSL. 
4. Open **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security** and create an **inbound rule** for port `1234`.
5. Set your Windows IP as the `nameserver` in `/etc/resolv.conf`.

## üöÄ Running the Simulation

> üßë‚Äçüíª For Windows 11 users, use WSL-Ubuntu 22.04 terminals.

1. Create your ROS2 workspace:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/WP1-Desert_lizard/src
    cd ~/WP1-Desert_lizard/src
    git clone https://github.com/SRU-CAVAA/WP1-Desert_lizard.git
    ```

2. Build the workspace:

    ```bash
    cd ~/WP1-Desert_lizard
    colcon build
    ```

3. Source the environment by editing your bashrc file: 

    ```bash
    cd
    sudo nano ~/.bashrc 
    ```

    Add the following at the end (adjust your paths if needed): 

    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash
    source ~/WP1-Desert_lizard/install/local_setup.bash
    ```

4. Save and close the file, then reload it:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

5. Open **six terminals** and run:

    - **Terminal 1**:
      ```bash
      ros2 launch webots_pkg mini_launch.py
      ```

    - **Terminal 2**:
      ```bash
      ros2 run webots_pkg gradients
      ```

    - **Terminal 3**:
      ```bash
      ros2 run webots_pkg allostatic_model
      ```

    - **Terminal 4**:
      ```bash
      ros2 run webots_pkg robot_navigation
      ```

    - **Terminal 5**:
      ```bash
      ros2 run webots_pkg data_gathering
      ```

    - **Terminal 6**:
      ```bash
      ros2 run webots_pkg supervisor
      ```

6. Alternatively to step 5, you can run a launch file including all the rest nodes. However, prints of each node will not be visible:

	- **Terminal 1**:
      ```bash
      ros2 launch webots_pkg full_launch.py
      ```
